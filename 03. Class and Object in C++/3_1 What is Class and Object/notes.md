# What is Class and Object ---> User Defined data type
C++ is an object-oriented programming language.

Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".

A class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions that can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.

A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines what data (called attributes or data members) and what actions (called methods or member functions) the object can have.

Think of it like a car design – it describes what a car is (wheels, engine, doors), but it’s not an actual car.

## Class
A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Object ---> class's variable
An object is a specific instance of a class. When you create an object, you're using the class blueprint to build a real thing in memory.

Think of it like an actual car built using the car design. You can have multiple cars (objects) from the same design (class).
