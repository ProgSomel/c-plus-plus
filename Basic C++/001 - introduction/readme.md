# Introduction to C++ Programming LanguageIntroduction to C++ Programming Language
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an enhancement of the C language to add object-oriented paradigm. making it suitable for both low-level system programming and high-level application development. It is a high-level programming language that was first released in 1985 and since then has become the foundation of many modern technologies like game engines, web browsers, operating systems, financial systems, etc.

## Features of C++
The main features C++ programming language are as follows:

- **Compiled & statically typed:** C++ code is compiled into machine code and types are checked at compile time.

- **Simple:** It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, and has a rich library support and a variety of datatypes.

- **Machine Independent:** C++ code can be run on any machine as long as a suitable compiler is provided.

- **Low-level Access:** C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.

- **Fast Execution Speed:** C++ is one of the fastest high-level languages. There is no additional processing overhead in C++, it is blazing fast.

- **Object-Oriented:** One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. large-scale applications can be built.

- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Reusable code for data structures and algorithms.

- **Multi-paradigm:** Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.


## Applications of C++
C++ is used in a wide range of applications from game engines and application software to operating systems and embedded systems.

## Why Learn C++?
C++ is often taught as a foundational language to aspiring programmers, but it is much more than that:

- **C++** remains one of the most used and **popular programming languages** used in making operating systems, embedded systems, graphical user interfaces and nowadays in high frequency trading (HFT) software.

- It supports **both low-level and high-level** features such as manual memory management and OOPs programming respectively.

- **Syntax similarity** with C, Java, and C# makes it easier to switch languages.

- C++ provides one of the **fastest execution speeds** among high level languages, which can be a deciding factor in Competitive Programming or high-performance applications.


## First C++ Program
The below program is one of the simplest C++ programs that shows the basic structure of its programs:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```
```bash
Hello, World!
```
**Explanation:** In the above example, we simply print a statement, which is "Hello, World!" through C++ programming language.


## History of C++
C++ was initially developed by Bjarne Stroutrup as an extension of C language to include OOPs concepts. It was first introduces as "C with Classes" in 1979 at Bell Labs. It was named C++ in 1982. The language later standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

- The first official standard **C++98** released in **1998**.

- This was followed by **C++03** in **2003** which was a minor update that addressed defects and clarified ambiguities in the **C++98** standard.

- The major update came with C++ 11 in 2011 which introduced a lot of features like lambda expressions, smart pointers, etc. After this, an update starts being released once in 3 years.

- C++14 (2014) and C++17 (2017), brought incremental improvements, refining C++11 features and adding new utilities like filesystem support.

- The latest major standards C++20 (2020) and C++23 (2024) continue to modernize the language with concepts, modules, and enhanced concurrency.

## ðŸš€ Common Use Cases
- Operating systems (like parts of Windows, Linux)

- Game development (Unreal Engine is C++ based)

- Embedded systems

- High-performance applications (e.g., databases, browsers)

- Competitive programming


## C++ vs Other Programming Languages
